Object Oriented Programming

4 Pillars of Object Oriented Programming
 1)Encapsulation
 2)Abstraction
 3)Inheritance
 4)Polymorphism

1)Encapsulation:
Object Contains Properties and method
We group related functions and properties together
Reduce Complexity
and increase Re usuability
2)Abstraction:
Hide the complex functionalties to user by creating a simple Interface and Reduce the Impact of change in code
Isolate Impact of changes
3)Inheritance:
It is used to elimenate the redundant.
Using the proprties and functionalities of common one
4)PolyMorphism:
Polymorphism means Many form
eliminates nasty Switch case Statements
